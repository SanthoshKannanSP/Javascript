# Task-8 - Single-Page Application (SPA) with Hash-based Routing

## Objective
- Build a basic SPA that navigates between different views without reloading the page.

## Requirements
- Implement hash-based routing by listening to the `window.onhashchange` event.
- Dynamically load different content sections based on the current URL hash.
- Maintain a consistent UI and state across route changes.
